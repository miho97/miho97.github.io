Say we want to measure suprise of the event occuring. We assume we have the definition of underlying probability space \(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \Bbb{P}).\ 
That is, we have exact probabilities of every element of $\mathcal{F}.$ Now let us define suprise function $s : \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \Bbb{R}.$
Increase of the probability of the event occuring should be inversly proportional to suprise of the event occuring. So for $A\in\mathcal{F}$ we need inverse relation between $s(A)$ and $\Bbb{P}(A)$. Increasing probability of the event should decrease suprise. Thus let us define \(s(A) = f(\Bbb{P}(A))\) and then solve for \f\.
Suprise of two independent events should be equal to sum of suprises of respective parts.
\[s(A\cup B) = s(A)+s(B) \implies f(\Bbb{P}(A\cup B)) = f(\Bbb{P}(A)) + f(\Bbb{P}(B))\]
